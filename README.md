This is the project for the course of Ingegneria del Software (Software Engineering) at Politecnico di Milano.
The scope of the project was to design and implement a board game in Java using the Model View Controller pattern for the structure of the game, and other patterns to create a well designed software that is also easy to maintain and update.
